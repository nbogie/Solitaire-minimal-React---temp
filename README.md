# Solitaire mechanism basic (React)

Testing the academy vite react starter template

From 25th Feb 2023 (so no advanced linting or prettier, but tests and basic lint)

## TO-DO list

-   do card-draw and re-shuffle the right way
-   allow drags back from home-piles to columns.
-   detect game over (win / loss)
-   show 10 as 10 not T
-   drag preview should show all cards not crop bounded by original card area.
-   widen drag and drop targets if possible?
